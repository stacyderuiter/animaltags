Mark is a senior research fellow at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. His research interests are in the development and application of high resolution biologging systems for studying wild animals. After completing a PhD in electronics engineering in New Zealand, he worked for 18 years at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in USA. There he joined with animal behaviourist, Peter Tyack, to develop a miniature sound and movement recording tag for cetaceans, dubbed the DTAG. This tag is now used widely in studies of foraging, social communication, locomotion and responses to anthropogenic sound in marine mammals. In 2011, Mark moved to St. Andrews where he is developing tags to study the long-term movements, behaviour and sound exposure of marine and terrestrial animals, with the goal of assessing the consequences of increasing environmental noise on animals.[Mark Johnson](https://www.soundtags.org/people/mark-johnson/)
