Lucía is a postgraduate researcher in the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St. Andrews, Scotland. She is a marine biologist, with a MRes In Marine Mammal Science and a PhD focused on studying the fine scale biomechanics and bioenergetics of marine mammal's locomotion. Lucía is interested in understanding how animals overcome and exploit forces to move efficiently in their natural environment, and how these biomechanical strategies of locomotion can be affected by anthropogenic disturbance.
