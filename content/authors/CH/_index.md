Catriona is a senior research fellow in the Centre for Research into Ecological and Environmental Modelling at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. She has been carrying out research on the impact of anthropogenic noise on marine mammals for 10 years, and specifically behavioural responses of marine mammals to noise for the last 5 years. Most recently she was co-PI on the [MOCHA project](https://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/mocha/),which developed analytical methods for analyzing data from behavioural response studies, primarily derived from DTAGS.
