The lists and links below are by no means comprehensive, nor do they reflect any biases or preferences, they were those that came easiest to our ageing minds.

## **Journals**
- [Animal Biotelemetry](https://animalbiotelemetry.biomedcentral.com/)  is a relatively new journal that focuses on tag data. It may be worth some exploration. Not all the articles in this journal are directly relevant to TagTools, since we focus on tag types that record movement data at high resolution (many times per second). So, for example, papers using data from GPS position-only tags would not be compatible with our TagTools. But there are many interesting papers there.
- [Movement Ecology](https://movementecologyjournal.biomedcentral.com/)  is an open-access interdisciplinary journal publishing novel insights from empirical and theoretical approaches into the ecology of movement of the whole organism – either animals, plants or microorganisms – as the central theme.
- [Journal of Experimental Biology](http://jeb.biologists.org/) is the leading primary research journal in comparative physiology and publishes papers on the form and function of living organisms at all levels of biological organisation, from the molecular and subcellular to the integrated whole animal.
- [Journal of Animal Ecology](http://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2656/)
