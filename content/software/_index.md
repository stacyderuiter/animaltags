The Animal Tag Tools originated in Matlab, so many of the file in/out and calibration tools will be translated from [Matlab](https://uk.mathworks.com/) to [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Currently tools have been written and tested in Matlab, GNU Octave, and R. The tagTools team is working hard to ensure that the tagTools are available in other languages such as [Python](https://www.python.org/) and are looking for users to help port the tagTools to other languages. If you can help please contact the team.

### R
R is a GNU open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics that is supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis While R has a command line interface, there are several graphical front-ends available, we will be using R via the RStudio IDE (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_languag

#### Getting R and Rstudio
[Download and install R](https://cran.r-project.org/) from the [R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). The latest version of R is 3.4.1 (Single Candle). R is available for a wide variety of UNIX platforms, macOS & Windows.

[RStudio Desktop Open Source Edition](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download2/) is available from RStudio and requires R2.11.1+ to be installed. The lastest version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is 1.0.153, and it is available for Linux, macOS and Windows.
